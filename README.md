# Cue
A game that is a mixture of classic 2D top-down shooters and billiards

To run the code, run ServerMain.java in Cue/tree/master/src/ip/milton/cue/server/execution
Then run two instances of CueMain.java in Cue/tree/master/src/ip/milton/cue/Client/execution

In the prompted fields of the clients, type in the host name and port number (both of which are displayed in the server GUI) and click connect to game
